# I'm making a game about going through a corn maze.
- I don't want to make it too deep. I kind of want to make it as I go.
- I don't really know what its going to be about yet. But I want to have something kind of done in a week. And I really want to make all of the Art and Music.

## Combat
- Combat is a real-time minigame that takes place during battles in the game.
- The goal of the minigame is to dodge an infinite number of projectiles/enemies for as long as possible.
- The longer the player survives, the more damage they accumulate.
- The accumulated damage is added to the player's next attack.
- However, if the player is hit even once, they die and lose all accumulated damage.
- To successfully deal the accumulated damage, the player must escape the minigame by reaching the edge of the minigame bounds.
